# ShopMe

### Overview 📑

- ShopeMe is an ecommerce based web application built using nodejs and pug. It is a simple view and buy product application where you can just view, search the products and order them after the payment.

### Limitation 😥

- It is not responsive at all mainly developed for web or large screen(1920 - 1080). So if u want to view on your screen zoom out a bit. Thank you 🙏.
- It is based on simple view and buy feature app so you can't remove the order or add products to the cart.
- You can buy the product one at a time.
